A Flutter application.

This application is used to upload joborder photos, upload workorder photo,
and scan QR used internally for and by Wellmade Motors.

The open camera app is required because it allows to set dimensions of photo
captured of 800 x 600 required by Wellmade Motors joborder system. The image
will not upload if it is not 800 x 600 in dimension and its size is over 256 KB.

notes:
The build folder exists within this project's root directory but has since excluded
in the github repository because the folder size is almost 500 MB. The build folder
is saved in the developer's computer or at his cloud storage account or at his storage USB, SD Card
and should be copy-pasted to its project's root if you want to develop this project in any computer.
